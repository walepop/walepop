The issue of demand affects most businesses and it is the same for the transportation business.
In this work, I attempt to build a model that uses the daily number of pickup rides for yellow taxi in New York city to estimate demand. For this work, Iâ€™ll attempt to use ARIMA model to predict yellow taxi demands by riders. The data set contains the hourly picked up rides for the month of March by New York Yellow taxis.
